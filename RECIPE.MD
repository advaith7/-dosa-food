//Add few drops of oil to a pan. Rub the pan with an onion slice till no excess of oil is in the pan

//Heat the pan on medium high heat

//When the pan is hot enough, pour a ladle full of batter on the centre of the pan and spread it in a circular manner to a thin crepe

//Add oil to the edges of the dosa and once it gets cooked the margins of the dosa will raise from the pan.

// keep spreading it from the centre making circle till you reach the edges

// regulate the to slightly high and let it cook for a minute then add oil or butter towards the edges. the edges of the dosa will leave the pan
